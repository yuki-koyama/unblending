Unblending is a C++ library for decomposing a target image into a set of semi-transparent layers associated with *advanced color-blend modes* (e.g., "multiply" and "color-dodge"). Output layers can be imported to Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, GIMP, Krita, etc. and are useful for performing complex edits that are otherwise difficult.

- `unblending` is a library that provides the main functionality for the use from other programs.
- `unblending-cli` is an executable with a command line interface to use the main functionality.
- `unblending-gui` is an executable with a graphical user interface to use the main functionality with interactive specification of necessary input parameters.

## Publication

Yuki Koyama and Masataka Goto. 2018. Decomposing Images into Layers with Advanced Color Blending. Comput. Graph. Forum 37, 7, pp.397--407 (2018). (a.k.a. Proceedings of Pacific Graphics 2018) DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13577>

This library is provided mainly for researchers who want to use or extend the method described in the above paper. We also expect that this library is useful for developers who plan to use the method in their software.

## Demo

## Dependencies

- cxxopts <https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts> (included as gitsubmodule)
- json11 <https://github.com/dropbox/json11> (included as gitsubmodule)
- NLopt <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/> (included as gitsubmodule)
- nlopt-util <https://github.com/yuki-koyama/nlopt-util> (included as gitsubmodule)
- parallel-util <https://github.com/yuki-koyama/parallel-util> (included as gitsubmodule)
- timer <https://github.com/yuki-koyama/timer> (included as gitsubmodule)
- tinycolormap <https://github.com/yuki-koyama/tinycolormap> (included as gitsubmodule)
- Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>
- Qt5 <https://www.qt.io/>

## Prerequisites

Eigen (3.x.x) and Qt (5.x.x) need to be installed beforehand.

### macOS

```bash
brew install eigen qt@5
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install qt5-default libeigen3-dev
```

## Build Using CMake

Unblending is organized using `cmake` and is built by the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuki-koyama/unblending.git --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../unblending
make
```
This process builds a static library (e.g., `libunblending.a`) and a command line interface (CLI) named `unblending-cli`.

The CLI can be used by the following command:
```bash
./unblending-cli/unblending-cli [-o <output-dir-path>] [-w <target-image-width>] <input-image-path> <layer-infos-path>
```

The GUI allows you to interactively specify necessary parameters. Currently the GUI is tested on macOS only (pull requests are highly appreciated).

## Build and Run Using Docker

If you use `docker`, you can easily build the CLI by `docker build`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuki-koyama/unblending.git --recursive
cd unblending
docker build -t unblending-cli:latest .
```

Then, you can use the CLI by `docker run`:
```bash
docker run --rm --volume $(pwd):/tmp -it unblending-cli:latest [-o <output-dir-path>] [-w <target-image-width>] <input-image-path> <layer-infos-path>
```

For example, the following command generates results into a sub directory named `output`:
```bash
docker run --rm --volume $(pwd):/tmp -it unblending-cli:latest -o /tmp/output -w 120 /tmp/examples/magic.png /tmp/examples/magic.json
```
Note: this typically takes around 10--30 seconds with consumer-level laptops.
